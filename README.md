# CS341 - Foundations of Computer Science 2

### Description
This class builds upon material learned in Foundations of Computer Science which was mainly focused on Discrete Math and set theory. This class will use the knowledge of sets and set theory to create Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) and Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFA), which are essential state machines that either accept or reject a given input.
